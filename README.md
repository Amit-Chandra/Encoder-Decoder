# Encoder-Decoder Project using Python Flask

This is a simple web application built using Python Flask that demonstrates encoding and decoding text messages. It encodes messages by adding random characters at the beginning and end of each word (except for words shorter than 3 characters), and decodes messages by reversing the encoding process.

## Features
- Encode and decode text messages.
- Random character addition to the words for encoding.
- Reverse the process for decoding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Flask if you haven't already:

pip install flask

3. Navigate to the project directory and run the app:

python app.py

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage
1. Enter a message in the input field.
2. Select whether you want to encode or decode the message.
3. Click the submit button.
4. The encoded or decoded message will be displayed.

## Example
- Input: "Hello world"
- Output (Encoded): "asgHelloa asdworlda"
- Output (Decoded): "Hello world"
